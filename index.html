         <h2>Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts fromaly Cooking School Of The Rockies</h2>

         Completions of 30-week diploma program prepares me to enter the culinary workforce
         in settings such as restaurants,country clubs, resorts, hotels and many other
         food service opportunities.
         I gained an insider understanding of classical and universal culinary
         techniques in a hands-on setting, as two-thirds of this program was in the 
         practical application of knowledge and skills. 
         This program offered a 6-week externship component as well to further bridge 
         classroom learning with a culinary job role. 
         To enhance this externship, Escoffier emphasizes career,
         personal development and entrepreneurial skills during this program.
